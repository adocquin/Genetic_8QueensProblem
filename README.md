# Genetic_8QueensProblem
## Introduction
Project realized during my international exchange program at Ahlia University. The goal was to implement the genetic algorithm to solve the 8 queens problem.  
Explanation of the algorithm is in the docs/documentation.pdf file.

## Usage
`py Genetic_8QueensProblem.py` To execute the program.
